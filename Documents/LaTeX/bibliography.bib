	abstract = {Prostate segmentation aids in prostate volume estimation, multi-modal image registration, and to create patient specific anatomical models for surgical planning and image guided biopsies. However, manual segmentation is time consuming and suffers from inter-and intra-observer variabilities. Low contrast images of trans rectal ultrasound and presence of imaging artifacts like speckle, micro-calcifications, and shadow regions hinder computer aided automatic or semi-automatic prostate segmentation. In this paper, we propose a prostate segmentation approach based on building multiple mean parametric models derived from principal component analysis of shape and posterior probabilities in a multi-resolution framework. The model parameters are then modified with the prior knowledge of the optimization space to achieve optimal prostate segmentation. In contrast to traditional statistical models of shape and intensity priors, we use posterior probabilities of the prostate region determined from random forest classification to build our appearance model, initialize and propagate our model. Furthermore, multiple mean models derived from spectral clustering of combined shape and appearance parameters are applied in parallel to improve segmentation accuracies. The proposed method achieves mean Dice similarity coefficient value of 0.91. ±. 0.09 for 126 images containing 40 images from the apex, 40 images from the base and 46 images from central regions in a leave-one-patient-out validation framework.

Nevertheless, ultrasound attenuation and shadowing artifacts cannot be entirely avoided and continue to challenge medical image computing algorithms. We introduce a method for estimating a per-pixel confidence in the information depicted by ultrasound images, referred to as an ultrasound confidence map, which emphasizes uncertainty in attenuated and/or shadow regions. Our main novelty is the modeling of the confidence estimation problem within a random walks framework by taking into account ultrasound specific constraints. The solution to the random walks equilibrium problem is global and takes the entire image content into account. As a result, our method is applicable to a variety of ultrasound image acquisition setups. We demonstrate the applicability of our confidence maps for ultrasound shadow detection, 3D freehand ultrasound reconstruction, and multi-modal image registration. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In ultrasound images, acoustic shadows appear as regions of low signal intensity linked to boundaries with very high acoustic impedance differences. Acoustic shadows can be viewed either as informative features to detect lesions or calcifications, or as damageable artifacts for image processing tasks such as segmentation, registration or 3D reconstruction. In both cases, the detection of these acoustic shadows is useful. This paper proposes a new method to detect these shadows that combines a geometrical approach to estimate the B-scans shape, followed by a statistical test based on a dedicated modeling of ultrasound image statistics. Results demonstrate that the combined geometrical-statistical technique is more robust and yields better results than the previous statistical technique. Integration of regularization over time further improves robustness. Application of the procedure results in (1) improved 3D reconstructions with fewer artifacts, and (2) reduced mean registration error of tracked intraoperative brain ultrasound images. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Lateral and axial resolution limitations are artifactual in nature since a failure to resolve means a loss of detail and two adjacent structures may be visualized as one. Apparent resolution close to the transducer (speckle) is not directly related to tissue texture but is a result of interference effects from the distribution of scatterers in the tissue. Reverberation produces a set of equally spaced artifactual echoes distal to the real reflectors. The mirror image artifact is the presentation of objects that are present on one side of a strong reflector, appearing on the other side as well. Shadowing and enhancement are useful artifacts for determining the nature of masses. Enhancement results from low attenuation objects in the sound path while shadowing results from strongly reflecting or strongly attenuating objects. Additional artifacts include section thickness, refraction, multipath, side lobe, grating lobe, focal enhancement, comet tail, ring down, speed error, and range ambiguity.}

These echoes shifted slowly when the patient was reexamined in a different position. Four of seven cholesterol stones containing more than 88{\%} cholesterol floated and produced a sonic shadow without internal echoes or with an area of internal echoes within the gallbladder at a distance from the posterior wall.

	abstract = {We conducted this study to develop an ultrasound-guided approach for facet joint injections of the lumbar spine. Five zygapophyseal joints (L1-S1) on each side of 5 embalmed cadavers were examined by ultrasound for a total of 50 examinations. The joint space was demonstrated under ultrasound guidance. The midpoint of the joint space, defined as the middle of its cranio-caudal extension on its dorsal surface, was taken as a reference point, and its position was computed from its depth and lateral distance from the spinous process. Forty-two of 50 approaches could be clearly visualized. Subsequently, these distances were compared to those obtained by computed tomography (CT). To assess the efficacy of ultrasound in the needle placement, all lumbar facet joints were approached in one embalmed cadaver. The exact placement of the needle tips was again evaluated by CT. Ultrasound and CT measurements showed the same mean depth and lateral distance to the reference point, 3.15 +/- 0.5 cm and 1.9 +/- 0.6 cm, respectively. Pearson's coefficient of correlation was 0.86 (P {\textless} 0.0001) between ultrasound and CT. All 10 needle tips were within the joint space during simulated facet joint injections. We conclude that ultrasound guidance might be a useful adjunct for facet joint injections in the lumbar spine. IMPLICATIONS: This study was designed to develop an ultrasound-guided approach to the facet joints of the lumbar spine and to assess its feasibility and accuracy by means of a comparison to computed tomography images. The imaging study demonstrated a significant correlation between ultrasound and computed tomography measurements. During simulated facet injection, ultrasound guidance consistently resulted in accurate needle placement.},

@article{Hetherington2017,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Percutaneous spinal needle insertion procedures often require proper identification of the vertebral level to effectively and safely deliver analgesic agents. The current clinical method involves "blind" identification of the vertebral level through manual palpation of the spine, which has only 30{\%} reported accuracy. Therefore, there is a need for better anatomical identification prior to needle insertion. METHODS: A real-time system was developed to identify the vertebral level from a sequence of ultrasound images, following a clinical imaging protocol. The system uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify transverse images of the lower spine. Several existing CNN architectures were implemented, utilizing transfer learning, and compared for adequacy in a real-time system. In the system, the CNN output is processed, using a novel state machine, to automatically identify vertebral levels as the transducer moves up the spine. Additionally, a graphical display was developed and integrated within 3D Slicer. Finally, an augmented reality display, projecting the level onto the patient's back, was also designed. A small feasibility study [Formula: see text] evaluated performance. RESULTS: The proposed CNN successfully discriminates ultrasound images of the sacrum, intervertebral gaps, and vertebral bones, achieving 88{\%} 20-fold cross-validation accuracy. Seventeen of 20 test ultrasound scans had successful identification of all vertebral levels, processed at real-time speed (40 frames/s). CONCLUSION: A machine learning system is presented that successfully identifies lumbar vertebral levels. The small study on human subjects demonstrated real-time performance. A projection-based augmented reality display was used to show the vertebral level directly on the subject adjacent to the puncture site.},

We show that this learning-based segmentation method is robust, multi-region, flexible and can be easily adapted to different modalities. In the attempt to show the capabilities and the behaviour of CNNs when they are applied to medical image analysis, we perform a systematic study of the performances of six different network architectures, conceived according to state-of-the-art criteria, in various situations. We evaluate the impact of both different amount of training data and different data dimensionality (2D, 2.5D and 3D) on the final results.

	abstract = {In ultrasound imaging, various statistical distributions have been proposed to model the first-order statistics of the amplitude of the echo envelope. We present an overview of these distributions based on their compound representation, which comprises three aspects: the modulated distribution (Rice or Nakagami); the modulating distribution (gamma, inverse Gaussian or even generalized inverse Gaussian); and the modulated parameters (the diffuse signal power with or without the coherent signal component or the coherent signal power). This unifying point of view makes the comparison of the various models conceptually easier. In particular, we discuss the implications of the modulated parameters on the mean intensity and the signal-to-noise ratio of the intensity in the case of a vanishing diffuse signal. We conclude that the homodyned K-distribution is the only model among the literature for which the parameters have a physical meaning that is consistent with the limiting case, although the other distributions may fit real data.

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.Purpose: Statistical modeling of an ultrasound backscattered echo envelope is used for tissue characterization. However, in the presence of complex structures within the analyzed area, estimation of parameters is disturbed and unreliable, e.g., in the case of breast tumor classification. In order to improve the differentiation of breast lesions, the authors proposed a method based on the segmentation of homodyned K distribution parameter maps. Regions within lesions of different scattering properties were extracted and analyzed. In order to improve the classification, the best-performing features were selected from various regions and then combined. Methods: A radio-frequency data set consisting of 103 breast lesions was used in the authors analysis. Maps of homodyned K distribution parameters were created using an algorithm based on signal-to-noise ratio, kurtosis, and skewness of fractional-order envelope moments. A Markov random field model was used to segment parametric maps. Features of different segments were extracted and evaluated based on bootstrapping and the receiver operating characteristic curve. To determine the best-performing feature subset, the authors applied the joint mutual information criterion. Results: It was found that there were individual features which performed better than the ones commonly used for lesion characterization, like the parameter obtained through averaging of values over the whole lesion. The authors selected and discussed the best-performing features. Properties of different extracted regions were important and improved the distinction between benign and malignant tumors. The best performance was obtained by combining four features with the area under the receiver operating curve of 0.84. Conclusions: The study showed that the analysis of internal changes in lesion parametric maps leads to a better classification of breast tumors. The authors recommend combining multiple features for characterization, instead of using only one parameter, especially in the case of heterogeneous lesions.},

	abstract = {This study explored the feasibility of using the ultrasound Nakagami image to assess the degree of liver fibrosis in rats. The rat has been widely used as a model in investigations of liver fibrosis. Ultrasound grayscale imaging makes it possible to observe fibrotic rat livers in real time. Statistical analysis of the envelopes of signals backscattered from rat livers may provide useful clues about the degree of liver fibrosis. The Nakagami-model-based image has been shown to be useful for characterizing scatterers in tissues by reflecting the echo statistics, and hence the Nakagami image may serve as a functional imaging tool for quantifying rat liver fibrosis. To validate this idea, fibrosis was induced in each rat liver (n = 21) by an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5{\%} dimethylnitrosamine. Livers were excised from rats for in vitro ultrasound scanning using a single-element transducer. The backscattered-signal envelopes of the acquired raw ultrasound signals were used for Nakagami imaging. The Metavir score determined by a pathologist was used to histologically quantify the degree of liver fibrosis. It was found that the Nakagami image could be used to distinguish different degrees of liver fibrosis in rats, since the average Nakagami parameter increased from 0.55 to 0.83 as the fibrosis score increased from 0 (i.e., normal) to 4. This correlation may be due to liver fibrosis in rats involving an increase in the concentration of local scatterers and the appearance of the periodic structures or clustering of scatterers that would change the backscattering statistics. The current findings indicate that the ultrasound Nakagami image has great potential as a functional imaging tool to complement the use of the conventional B-scan in animal studies of liver fibrosis.

@article{Jensen2007,
	abstract = {The paper gives an introduction to current medical ultrasound imaging systems. The basics of anatomic and blood flow imaging are described. The properties of medical ultrasound and its focusing are described, and the various methods for two- and three-dimensional imaging of the human anatomy are shown. Systems using both linear and non-linear propagation of ultrasound are described. The blood velocity can also be non-invasively visualized using ultrasound and the basic signal processing for doing this is introduced. Examples for spectral velocity estimation, color flow imaging and the new vector velocity images are presented. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
